# Design Choices

1. Color Palette: I used a warm, royal color scheme with golds (#d4af37, #b8860b), deep browns (#3d2c1d, #5a4738), and creams (#f9f5ed, #f0e6d3) to evoke the elegance of royal Indian tradition and the rich color of chai tea.

2. Typography: I paired the elegant serif font "Cinzel" for headings with the clean sans-serif "Inter" for body text, creating a contrast that balances luxury with readability.

3. Visual Elements: The circular logo with crown-inspired design, chai cup illustration with steam animation, and decorative gold accents throughout create a cohesive royal aesthetic that reflects the brand's premium positioning.
